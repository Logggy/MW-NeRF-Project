# MW-NeRF

![Hero](/assets/image17.png)

MW-NeRF extends Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to handle **complex lighting and shadows** in **space-based imagery** for spacecraft modeling and reconstruction.

- **Why**: Collision avoidance and risk assessment need fast, lightweight, and accurate shape models.
- **Problem**: Vanilla NeRFs struggle in **shadows**, leading to incomplete reconstructions.
- **Our solution**: **Multi-Wavelength training** â†’ robust features, complete geometry, stable learning.
